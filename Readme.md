# Applied Machine Learning with Python

## About this course

This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis.

## Introduction

### Definition Machine Learning (ML)

* The study of computer programs (algorithms)
that can learn by example
* ML algorithms can generalize from existing
examples of a task

### Types of Machine Learning

1. #### Supervised ML

   Learn to predict target values from labelled data.

    1. Classification: Target values with discrete classes  
        eg: Differentiate between fruit types
    2. Regression: Target values are continuous values.  
        eg: Predict house price

2. #### Unsupervised ML

    Find structure in unlabeled data

    1. Clustering: Find groups of similar instances in the data.  
        eg: Finding clusters of similar users.
    2. Outlier detection: Detecting abnormal server access patterns.  
        eg: Predict house price

### Basic Machine Learning Workflow

1. Representation  
    Choose:
    * A feature representation
    * Type of classifier to use  
        e.g. image pixels, with k-nearest neighbor classifier
2. Evaluation  
    Choose:
    * What criterion distinguishes good vs. bad classifiers?  
        e.g. % correct predictions on test set
3. Optimization  
    Choose:
    * How to search for the settings/parameters that give the best classifier for this evaluation criterion.  
        e.g. try a range of values for "k" parameter in k-nearest neighbor classifier

## Getting Started

1. Look at what kind of feature preprocessing is typically needed.

    * Notice missing data.
    * Gain insight on what machine learning model might be appropriate, if any.
    * Get a sense of how difficult the program might be.
    * Feature normalization:
      * MinMax Scaling: transform all the input variables, so they're all on the same scale between zero and one.

        ```python
        from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
        scaler = MinMaxScaler()
        scaler.fit(x_train)   # compute the min and max feature   values for each feature in this training dataset.
        X_trained_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
        X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
        clf = Ridge().fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
        r2_score = clf.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
        # or more efficiently fit and transform in one step
        X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
        ```

        Critical aspects to feature normalization:
        1. Apply the same scalar object to both training and testing data.
        2. Training the scalar object on the training data and not on the test data. If it trained on the test data, it will cause a phenomena called Data Leakage, where the training phase has information that is leaked from the test set.
    * Polynomial Features
    ![Polynomial-Features_equation](/images/Polynomial&#32;features&#32;equation.jpg)
      * Generate new features consisting of all polynomial combinations of the original two features ùë•0,ùë•1.
      * The degree of the polynomial specifies how many variables participate at a time in each new feature (above example: degree 2).
      * This is still a weighted linear combination of features, so it's still a linear model, and can use same least-squares estimation method for w and b.
      * Adding these extra polynomial features allows us a much richer set of complex functions that we can use to fit to the data.
      * This intuitively as allowing polynomials to be fit to the training data instead of simply a straight line, but using the same least-squares criterion that minimizes mean squared error.
      * We want to transform the data this way to capture interactions between the original features by adding them as features to the linear model.
      * Polynomial feature expansion with high as this can lead to complex models that over-fit.
      * Polynomial feature expansion is often combined with a regularized learning method like ridge regression.

        ```python
        from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
        from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
        from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =  train_test_split(x    y, random_state = 0)

        linreg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)

        poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
        X_poly = poly.fit_transform(x)

        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =  train_test_split(X_poly,y, random_state = 0)

        linreg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
        ```

2. Split dataset into features X and labels y

3. Split X and y

    1. With a percentage for training the algorithm and the remaining for testing its accuracy

        ```python
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =
        train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)
        ```

    2. Cross Validation:
       * Cross-validation is a method that goes beyond evaluating a single model using a single Train/Test split of the data by using multiple Train/Test splits, each of which is used to train and evaluate a separate model.
       * So why is this better than our original method of a single Train/Test split? Bec. the accuracy score you get from running a classifier can vary quite a bit just by chance depending on the specific samples that happen to end up in the training set.
       * Cross-validation basically gives more stable and reliable estimates of how the classifiers likely to perform on average by running multiple different training test splits and then averaging the results.
       * The most common type of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation most commonly with K set to 5 or 10. For example, to do five-fold cross-validation, the original dataset is partitioned into five parts of equal or close to equal size. Each of these parts is called a "fold". Then a series of five models is trained one per fold. The first model: Model one, is trained using folds 2 through 5 as the training set and evaluated using fold 1 as the test set. The second model: Model 2, is trained using Folds 1, 3, 4, and 5 as the training set, and evaluated using Fold 2 as the test set, and so on. When this process is done, we have five accuracy values, one per fold.
       * One benefit of computing the accuracy of a model on multiple splits instead of a single split, is that it gives us potentially useful information about how sensitive the model is to the nature of the specific training set. It does take more time and computation to do cross-validation.
       * One problem with this is that the records are sorted or at least show some bias in the ordering by class label. For example, the first 20% of the data has the same label. `scikit-learn` do cross-validation for a classification task, it actually does instead what's called "Stratified K-fold Cross-validation". The Stratified Cross-validation means that when splitting the data, the proportions of classes in each fold are made as close as possible to the actual proportions of the classes in the overall data set as shown here. While for regression, `scikit-learn` uses regular k-fold cross-validation.

            ```python
            from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

            clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 5)
            X = X_fruits_2d.as_matrix()
            y = y_fruits_2d.as_matrix()
            cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv = 3)
            # clf: the model you want to evaluate
            # X, y: dataset
            # cv: the corresponding ground truth target labels or values. By default, cross_val_score does threefold cross-validation.
            print('Cross-validation scores (3-fold):', cv_scores)
            print('Mean cross-validation score (3-fold): {:.3f}'.format(np.mean(cv_scores)))
            ```

    3. Validation Curve:
        * To evaluate the effect that an important parameter of a model has on the cross-validation scores.
        * Like cross-value score, validation curve will do threefold cross-validation by default but it can be adjusted with the CV parameter as well.
        * Unlike cross_val_score, you can also specify a classifier, parameter name, and set of parameter values, you want to sweep across.
        * So you first pass in the estimator object, or that is the classifier or regression object to use, followed by the data set samples X and target values Y, the name of the parameter to sweep, and the array of parameter values that that parameter should take on in doing the sweep.
        * It will return two two-dimensional arrays corresponding to evaluation on the training set and the test set. Each array has one row per parameter value in the sweep, and the number of columns is the number of cross-validation folds that are used.

            ```python
            from sklearn.svm import SVC
            from sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve

            param_range = np.logspace(-3, 3, 4)
            train_scores, test_scores = validation_curve(SVC(), X, y,
                                            param_name='gamma',
                                            param_range=param_range, cv=3)
            ```

## Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

The supervised aspect refers to the need for each training example to have a label in order for the algorithm to learn how to make accurate predictions on future examples.
This is in contrast to unsupervised machine learning where we don't have labels for the training data examples, and we'll cover unsupervised learning in a later part of this course.

1. ### K-nearest neighbor

    * It is a type of machine learning algorithm.
    * It can be used for classification and regression.
    * It is an example of what's called instance based or memory based supervised learning.
    * It returns a classifier that classifies the input with respect to the nearest n_neighbors neighbors that is the most predominant.  
    K-nearest neighbors doesn't make a lot of assumptions about the structure of the data and gives potentially accurate, but sometimes unstable predictions
    * It can be sensitive to small changes in the training data.
    * It can be used in python as below:
        1. Initiate a variable as

            ```python
            knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors)
            ```

        2. Train the model to memorize all its features and labels

            ```python
            knn.fit()
            ```

        3. To predict a label use the below function with 1 parameter that has the same number of feature as the trained data

            ```python
            knn.predict(param)
            ```

        4. The accuracy can be tested by passing testing data and testing labels

            ```python
            knn.score(X_test, y_test)
            ```

2. ### Linear Model

    * Linear models make strong assumptions about the structure of the data.
    * The target value can be predicted just using a weighted sum of the input variables, a linear function.
    * It can get stable, but potentially inaccurate predictions.

    1. Linear Regression  
        ![equation](images/Linear&#32;equation.jpg)  
        <!-- $$
        \hat{y} = \hat{w_0}x_0 + \hat{w_1} x_1 + ... \hat{w_n} x_n + \hat{b}
        $$ -->
        The hat(^) is an indication that the parameter is estimated during training process.  
        **y**: the predicted output.  
        **w_i**: the model coefficients or feature weights.  
        **b**: the biased term or intercept of the model.

        w, b parameters are estimated by:

        * They are estimated from training the data.
        * There are different methods correspond to different 'fit' criteria and goals and ways to control complexity.
        * `Squared loss function` returns the squared difference between the target value and the  actual value as the penalty.
        * The learning algorithm then computes or searches for the set of w, b parameters that optimize an objective function, typically to minimize the total of this loss function over all training points.

        1. Least Squares:
            ![Least-squares_equation](images/Least-squares&#32;Equation.jpg)
            * The most popular way to estimate w and b parameters is using what's called least-squares linear regression or ordinary least-squares. Least-squares finds the values of w and b that minimize the total sum of squared differences between the predicted y value and the actual y value in the training set. Or equivalently it minimizes the mean squared error of the model.
            * This technique is designed to find the slope, the w value, and the b value of the y intercept, that minimize this squared error, this mean squared error.
            * The mean squared error is the square difference between predicted and actual values, and then all these are added up, and then divided by the number of training points, take the average, that will be the mean squared error of the model.
            * One thing to note about this linear regression model is that there are no parameters to control the model complexity. No matter what the value of w and b, the result is always going to be a straight line. This is both a strength and a weakness of the model.

                ```python
                from sklearn.linear_model importLinearRegression

                X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test=train_test_split(X_R1, y_R1, random_state=0)

                linreg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train,y_train)

                # w_i: coefficients
                linreg.coef_
                # b: the intercept term
                linreg.intercept_

                #! In Scikit-Learn object attribute endswith an underscore, this means that thisattribute is derived from the trainingdata, not quantities that set by the user.
                ```

        2. Ridge Regression:  
            ![ridge_equation](/images/Ridge&#32;Equation.jpg)
            * Ridge regression uses the same least-squares criterion, but with one difference. During the training phase, it adds a penalty for large feature weights in w parameters.
            * Once the parameters are learned, its prediction formula is the same as ordinary least-squares.
            * The addition of a parameter penalty is called regularization. Regularization prevents over fitting by restricting the model, typically to reduce its complexity.
            * It uses L2 regularization: minimize sum of squares of w entries.
            * If ridge regression finds two possible linear models that predict the training data values equally well, it will prefer the linear model that has a smaller overall sum of squared feature weights.
            * The amount of regularization to apply is controlled by the alpha parameter. Larger alpha means more regularization and simpler linear models with weights closer to zero.(default 1.0)

                ```python
                from sklearn.preprocessing importMinMaxScaler
                scaler = MinMaxScaler()

                from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
                X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =train_test_split(X_crime, y_crime,random_state=0)

                X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
                X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

                linridge = Ridge(alpha = 20.0).fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
                ```

        3. Lasso Regression
            ![Lasso_equation](/images/Lasso&#32;Equation.jpg)
            * Like ridge regression, lasso regression adds a regularization penalty term to the ordinary least-squares objective, that causes the model W-coefficients to shrink towards zero.
            * Lasso regression is another form of regularized linear regression that uses an L1 regularization penalty for training (instead of ridge's L2 penalty).
            * L1 Penalty: minimizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.
            * This has the effect of setting parameter weights in w to zero for the least influential variables. This called a sparse solution: a kind of feature selection.
            * The parameter alpha controls the amount of L1 regularization (default = 1.0).
            * The prediction formula is the same as ordinary least-squares.

                ```python
                from sklearn.preprocessing importMinMaxScaler
                scaler = MinMaxScaler()

                from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
                X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_crime, y_crime,random_state=0)

                X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transfor(X_train)
                X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

                linlasso = Lasso(alpha = 2.0, max_iter =10000) .fit(X-train_scaled, y_train)
                ```

                * When to use ridge vs lasso:
                  * Many small/medium sized effects: use ridge.
                  * Only a few variables with medium/large effect: use lasso.

    2. Linear Classification
        1. Support Vector Machines (SVC):
            * Linear models are also used for classification, starting with binary classification.
            * This approach uses the same linear functional form as for regression. But instead of predicting a continuous target value, we take the output of the linear function and apply the sine function to produce a binary output with two possible values, corresponding to the two possible class labels.
            * One way to define a good classifier is to reward classifiers for the amount of separation that can provide between the two classes (classifier margin). The margin is the width that the decision boundary can be increased perpendicularly before hitting a data point. The classifier that has the maximum margin is called the Linear Support Vector Machine, also known as an LSVM or a support vector machine with linear kernel.
            * How tolerant the support vector machine is of misclassifying training points, as compared to its objective of minimizing the margin between classes is controlled by a regularization parameter called C which by default is set to 1.0. Larger values of C represent less regularization and will cause the model to fit the training set with these few errors as possible, even if it means using a small immersion decision boundary. Very small values of C on the other hand use more regularization that encourages the classifier to find a large marge on decision boundary, even if that decision boundary leads to more points being misclassified.

        * **Linear Model Pros**:
          * Simple and easy to train.
          * Fast prediction.
          * Scales well to very large dataset.
          * Works well with sparse data.
          * Reasons for prediction are relatively easy to interpret.
        * **Linear Model Cons**:
          * For lower-dimensional data, other models may have superior generalization performance.
          * For classification, data may not be linearly separable.

    3. Logistic Regression  
        ![Flowchart box](images/Logistic&#32;Regression&#32;flow&#32;chart.jpg)  
        ![Logistic fn](images/Logistic&#32;Regression&#32;function.jpg)
       * It is a kind of generalized linear model.
       * In spite of being called a regression measure, it is actually used for classification
       * like ordinary least squares and other regression methods, logistic regression takes a set input variables, the features, and estimates a target value.
       * Unlike ordinary linear regression, in it's most basic form logistic repressions target value is a binary variable instead of a continuous value.
       * There are flavors of logistic regression that can also be used in cases where the target value to be predicted is a multi class categorical variable, not just binary.
       * Logistic regression is similar to linear regression, but with one critical addition. The logistic regression model still computes a weighted sum of the input features xi and the intercept term b (like in linear regression), but it runs this result through a special non-linear function f, the logistic function represented by this new box in the middle of the diagram to produce the output y. The effect of applying the logistic function is to compress the output of the linear function so that it's limited to a range between 0 and 1. Below the diagram, you can see the formula for the predicted output y hat which first computes the same linear combination of the inputs xi, model coefficient weights wi hat and intercept b hat, but runs it through the additional step of applying the logistic function to produce y hat.
       * If we pick different values for b hat and the w hat coefficients, we'll get different variants of this s shaped logistic function, which again is always between 0 and 1.
       * To perform logistic, regression in Scikit-Learn, you import the logistic regression class from the sklearn.linear model module, then create the object and call the fit method using the training data just as you did for other class files like k nearest neighbors.

            ```python
            from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_C2,   y_C2,random_state = 0)
            clf = LogisticRegression(C=1).fit(X_train, y_train)
            ```

         * L2 regularization is 'on' by default (like ridge regression)
         * Parameter C controls amount of regularization (default 1.0)
         * As with regularized linear regression, it can be important to normalize all features so that they are on the same scale.

    4. Kernelized Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
       * It is a very powerful extension of linear support vector machines, it can provide more complex models that can go beyond linear decision boundaries.
       * SVMs can be used for both classification and regression.
       * one way to think about what kernelized SVMs do, is they take the original input data space and transform it to a new higher dimensional feature space, where it becomes much easier to classify the transform to data using a linear classifier. (eg. instead of y(x) it became y(x,x^2) like polynomial feature).

       The above figure shows at the right that the points can be separated by a straight line after converting it to a two dimensional space, while on the left is the original one dimensional points in which the straight line is converted to a parabola.
       * An example of how it can be done using scikit-learn in Python.

            ```python
            from sklearn.svm import SVC
            from adspy_shared_utilities import              plot_class_regions_for_classifier

            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_D2, y_D2, random_state = 0)

            # The default SVC kernel is radial basis function (RBF)
            #! SVC() = SVC(kernel = 'rbf', gamma=1, C=1)

            plot_class_regions_for_classifier(SVC().fit(X_train, y_train), X_train, y_train, None, None, 'Support Vector Classifier: RBF kernel')

            # Compare decision boundaries with polynomial kernel, degree = 3
            plot_class_regions_for_classifier(SVC(kernel = 'poly', degree = 3).fit(X_train, y_train), X_train, y_train, None, None, 'Support Vector Classifier: Polynomial kernel, degree = 3')
            ```

            * Calling the fit method with the training data to train the model.
            * There is an SVC parameter called kernel, that allows us to set the kernel function used by the SVM. The polynomial kernel takes additional parameter degree that controls the model complexity and the computational cost of this transformation.
            * Small gamma means a larger similarity radius (give broader, smoother decision regions). So that points farther apart are considered similar . Which results in more points being group together. Small values of gamma. While larger values of gamma give smaller, more complex decision regions, tightly constrained decision boundaries.
            * SVMs also have a regularization parameter, C, that controls the tradeoff between satisfying the maximum margin criterion to find the simple decision boundary, and avoiding misclassification errors on the training set. The C parameter is also an important one for kernelized SVMs, and it interacts with the gamma parameter.

       * Pros:
          * Can perform well on a range of datasets.
          * Versatile: different kernel functions can be specified, or custom kernels can be defined for specific data types.
          * Works well for both low-and high-dimensional data.
       * Cons:
         * Efficiency (runtime speed and memory usage) decreases as training set size increases (e.g. over 50000 samples).
         * Needs careful normalization of input data and parameter tuning.
         * Does not provide direct probability estimates (but can be estimated using e.g. Platt scaling).
         * Difficult to interpret why a prediction was made.

    5. Decision tree

        ![Decision Tree Example](images/Descision&#32;Tree&#32;Example.jpg)
        * It can be used for both regression and classification.
        * It learns a series of explicit `if then` rules on feature values that result in a decision that predicts the target value. In this way any given object can be categorized as either matching the target object the first person is thinking of or not, according to its features as determined by asking the series of yes or no questions. We can form these questions into a tree with a node representing one question and the yes or no possible answers as the left and right branches from that node that connect the node to the next level of the tree. One question being answered at each level. At the bottom of the tree are nodes called leaf nodes that represent actual objects as the possible answers. For any object there's a path from the root of the tree to that object that is determined by the answers to the specific yes or no questions at each level.

            ```python
            from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
            from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
            from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

            iris = load_iris()

            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, random_state = 3)
            clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = 3, min_samples_leaf = 8).fit(X_train, y_train)
            ```

            * `max_depth`: controls maximum depth (number of split points). Most common way to reduce tree complexity and overfitting.
            * `min_samples_leaf`: threshold for the minimum # of data instances a leaf can have to avoid further splitting.
            * `max_leaf_nodes`: limits total number of leaves in the tree.
            * In practice, adjusting only one of these (e.g. max_depth) is enough to reduce overfitting.
        * **Over Fitting**
          * There is a problem with decision tree which is overfitting, due to its complexity and essentially memorizing the training data.
          * One strategy to prevent overfitting is to prevent the tree from becoming really detailed and complex by stopping its growth early. This is called pre-pruning.
          * Another strategy is to build a complete tree with pure leaves but then to prune back the tree into a simpler form. This is called post-pruning or sometimes just pruning.
        * **Feature Importance**
          * Another way of analyzing the tree instead of looking at the whole tree at once is to do what's called a feature important calculation.
          * one of the most useful and widely used types of summary analysis you can perform on a supervised learning model.
          * typically a number between 0 and 1 that's assigned to an individual feature.
          * It indicates how important that feature is to the overall prediction accuracy.
          * A feature importance of zero means that the feature is not used at all in the prediction. A feature importance of one, means the feature perfectly predicts the target.
          * Typically, feature importance numbers are always positive and they're normalized so they sum to one.
          * In `scikit-learn`, feature importance values are stored as a list in an estimated property called `feature_importances_`.
        * **Pros**:  
          * Easily visualized and interpreted.
          * No feature normalization or scaling typically needed.
          * Work well with datasets using a mixture of feature types (continuous, categorical, binary)
        * **Cons**:
          * Even after tuning, decision trees can often still overfit.
          * Usually need an ensemble of trees for better generalization performance.

## Aspects to be considered

1. ### Overfitting

    Informally, overfitting typically occurs when we try to fit a complex model with an inadequate amount of training data. And overfitting model uses its ability to capture complex patterns by being great at predicting lots and lots of specific data samples or areas of local variation in the training set. But it often misses seeing global patterns in the training set that would help it generalize well on the unseen test set.

2. ### Underfitting

    The model is too simple for the actual trends that are present in the data. It doesn't even do well on the training data and thus, is not at all likely to generalize well to test data.

* To avoid these, the below points would help:
  1. First, try to draw the data with respect to the labels and try to figure out the relationship between, whether its linear, quadratic, polynomial and so on.
  2. Reduce the number of features.
     1. Manually select which features to keep.
     2. Use a model selection algorithm.
  3. Regularization
     1. Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters.
     * It works well when there are a lot of slightly useful features.
